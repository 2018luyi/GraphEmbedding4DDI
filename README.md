# GraphEmbedding4DDI

In this work, we aimed to present realistic evaluation settings to predict DDIs using knowledge graph embeddings. We propose a simple disjoint cross-validation scheme to evaluate drug-drug interaction predictions for the scenarios where the drugs have no known DDIs.
 
We performed cross-validation using different settings:

### Time-slice CV:
